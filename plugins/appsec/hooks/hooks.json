Check for: missing authentication/authorization on new endpoints, input validation gaps, data exposure risks, missing encryption for sensitive data, third-party integration trust assumptions, and potential injection points. If security concerns are found, output a brief security advisory with specific issues and recommendations. If the plan looks security-sound, output nothing."

Look for: API keys (strings starting with sk-, pk-, AKIA, ghp_, xox), high-entropy strings assigned to variables named key/secret/token/password/credential, connection strings with embedded passwords, private key blocks (BEGIN RSA/EC/PRIVATE KEY).
